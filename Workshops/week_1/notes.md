In the first class we are essentially looking at Installation and set up, The full stack we are working with is:

Node.js
npm(node package manager)

to check these are installed or the versions we run these commands in terminal

node -v (the name of the application and -v call the version)
npm - v

We then create the appliaction which will set up our package manager using command 

npx create-next-app@latest my-app

within this we are able to set up parameter options

Typescript 
ESLint 
Tailwind CSS
src/ directory 
App Router

For the rest of the class we go over basic typescript skills, Type annotations, Interfaces and functions with types

Why so we need node and npm for a React development enviroment?

Node.js primarily serves as the JavaScript runtime enviroment that facilitates the entire dev workflow, Node.js provides
the tools and infrastructure for building, managing and deploying React applications.

NPM is used to manage package dependencies like React itself, libraries, frameworks and tools. 
npm will create your package.json automatically which lists all of the project dependecies and their versions 
to ensure a consistant set uo across different enviroments,.
